Hi Dad!  Happy Father's....Year?
Anyway, I love you and thought this would be a cool thing to do for you.
The idea is for you to have a way to request that I wrote some automated stuff that would help you do...whatever.
As an example, the first option will send me an email - you'd rather prefer just logging in to your email, but it's an example.
I know you can do most of this yourself, but maybe if you wanted to compare box-people simulations, we could do that here?

I'll be adding all of the stuff shortly - it'll be my pet project over the next few weeks, so if you draw this note first, just hang tight
and come up with ideas!
